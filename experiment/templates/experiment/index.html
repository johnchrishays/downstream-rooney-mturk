      <p> <strong>Study Title:</strong> On the Downstream Impact of the Generalized Rooney Rule </p>
      <p> <strong>Principal Investigator (the person who is responsible for this research):</strong> L. Elisa Celis <a href = "mailto: elisa.celis@yale.edu">elisa.celis@yale.edu</a> </p>

      <p> <u><strong>Research Study Summary:</strong></u> </p>
      <p> We are asking you to join a research study. The purpose of this research is to study how people learn to play a game over many repeated iterations. To participate in this study, you will play a simple game through Mechanical Turk. Your involvement will require less than {{ avg_n_minutes_to_complete }} minutes. There are no known or anticipated risks to you other than a possible loss of confidentiality. You will be compensated with a base payment of ${{ base_reward }} and an average bonus payment of ${{ avg_bonus_reward }}. </p>
      <p> Taking part in this study is your choice. You can choose to take part, or you can choose not to take part in this study.  You also can change your mind at any time and your base reward will not be affected. </p>
      <p> If you are interested in learning more about the study, please continue reading. Email <a href = "mailto: elisa.celis@yale.edu">elisa.celis@yale.edu</a> about anything you do not understand. Once you understand the study, we will ask you if you wish to participate; if so, you will have to e-sign sign this form. You must be 18 years of age or older to participate.</p>

      <p> <u><strong>What are you asking me to do and how long will it take? </strong></u></p>
      <p> If you agree to take part, your participation in this study will involve playing a simple online game. We think that the study will take less than {{ avg_n_minutes_to_complete }} minutes of your time. </p>

      <p> <u><strong>Are there any risks from participating in this research?</strong></u> </p>
      <p> We do not expect any risks from taking part in this study. </p>


      <p> <u><strong>Will I be paid for participation?</strong></u> </p>
      <p> You will be paid for taking part in this study. You will be awarded ${{ base_reward }} as a base reward, with an additional reward which depends on their performance in the game. The expected additional reward will be about ${{ avg_bonus_reward }}.</p>

      <p> <u><strong>How will you keep my data safe and private?</strong></u> </p>
      <p> Your data would be stored electronically. Only the researchers involved in this study and those responsible for research oversight (such as representatives of the Yale University Human Research Protection Program, the Yale University Institutional Review Boards, and others) will have access to any information that could identify you that you provide.  </p>

      <p> Participation is anonymous. We will not know your name. We will not be able to connect any identifying information to your survey answers. However, we will know your MTurk number in order to pay you for your time. Your MTurk number could possibly be connected to your public profile, which could, in theory, be searched. We want to stress that we will not be looking at anyoneâ€™s public profiles. We will keep the information about your participation in this research confidential. </p>

      <p> When we publish the results of the research or talk about it in conferences, we will not use your name or MTurk ID. We will also share information collected in the process of this study with other researchers for future research but we will not use your name, MTurk ID or other identifiers. We will not ask you for any additional permission. </p>

      <p> <u><strong>What if I want to refuse or end participation before the study is over?</strong></u> </p>
      <p>Taking part in this study is your choice. You can choose to take part, or you can choose not to take part in this study.  You also can change your mind at any time and this will not affect your base payment.</p>

      <p> <u><strong>Who should I contact if I have questions?</strong></u> </p>

      <p> Please feel free to ask about anything you don't understand. </p>

      <p> If you have questions later or if you have a research-related problem, you can email the Principal Investigator at <a href = "mailto: elisa.celis@yale.edu">elisa.celis@yale.edu</a>. </p>

      <p> If you have questions about your rights as a research participant, or you have complaints about this research, you call the Yale Institutional Review Boards at (203) 785-4688 or email <a href = "mailto: hrpp@yale.edu">hrpp@yale.edu</a>. </p>
